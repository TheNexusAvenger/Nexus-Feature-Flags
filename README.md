# Nexus-Feature-Flags
**Nexus Feature Flags is deprecated outside of Nexus Admin.
[`ConfigService`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ConfigService)
should be used instead.**

Nexus Feature Flags allows for developer-defined feature
flags to enable and disable features without updating the
game. Feature flags are synchronized between servers and
are accessible on the client and server.

## Usage
For in-game use, see [usage.md](docs/usage.md) for adding,
getting, setting, and monitoring feature flags. For external
tools that use Roblox Open Cloud, see [roblox-open-cloud.md](docs/roblox-open-cloud.md).

## Contributing
Both issues and pull requests are accepted for this project.

## License
Nexus Feature Flags is available under the terms of the MIT 
Liscence. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.
