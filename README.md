# Nexus-Feature-Flags
Nexus Feature Flags allows for developer-defined feature
flags to enable and disable features without updating the
game. Feature flags are synchronized between servers and
are accessible on the client and server.

## Usage
For in-game use, see [usage.md](docs/usage.md) for adding,
getting, setting, and monitoring feature flags. For external
tools that use Roblox Open Cloud, see [roblox-open-cloud.md](docs/roblox-open-cloud.md).

## Contributing

Liscence. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.
